# Almsivi Clock

This alarm will pick randomly from songs and will then go off every 5 minutes It can be used by others because you can input the starting time that you would like to sleep and will then have an alarm every 5 minutes after that

If you would like to run this program correctly run it once in a directory of your choosing, this will create two folders Backgroundsounds and Songs. Put in Backgroundsounds any .wav or .mp3 file that you would like to play behind you while this program runs, in Songs put in any .wav or .mp3 files you want to play when this alarm goes off

This requires python3 and pygame.
