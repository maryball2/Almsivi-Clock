# Python Alarm Mark II

This alarm will pick randomly from 11 songs and will then go off every 5 minutes It can be used by others because you can input the starting time that you would like to sleep and will then have an alarm every 5 minutes after that

If you would like to run this for yourself you need to download 10 songs in .wav file and change their names to the names of the songs in the code (or edit the code) and also need a background sound to play while you sleep. 

This requires python3 and pygame.
