# Python Alarm Mark II

This alarm will pick randomly from songs and will then go off every 5 minutes It can be used by others because you can input the starting time that you would like to sleep and will then have an alarm every 5 minutes after that

If you would like to run this program create a Songs folder in the same directory as the program and put any .wav files in there. Then create another one called Backgroundsounds and put any .wav that you want to be a background in there. Both of these steps are unneccessary but if you do not do them the program will only partially work.

This requires python3 and pygame.
