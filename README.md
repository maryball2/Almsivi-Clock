# Myalarmforthemorning
I have trouble waking up in the morning and I have trouble falling asleep. This program automatically sets my 300 alarms and automatically sets some traffic sounds to play in the background to help me sleep

If you would like to run this for yourself you need to download 10 songs in .wav file and change their names to the names of the songs in the code (or edit the code) and also need a background sound to play while you sleep. 

This requires python3 and pygame.
